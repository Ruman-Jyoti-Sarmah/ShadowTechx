## Backend Migration

### Migration Details
- **Reason for Migration**: Migrated from Node.js backend to PHP Laravel backend for improved performance and maintainability.
- **Date of Archival**: December 27, 2025
- **Archived Backend Location**: The old Node.js backend has been moved to `_archived_node_backend/` folder for backup purposes.

### Restoring Node.js Backend (if needed)
1. Rename the `_archived_node_backend/` folder back to `backend/`.
2. Navigate to the `backend/` directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Start the server using `npm start` or the appropriate command from the package.json scripts.

Note: The Node.js backend is archived and not intended to be run in the current setup. The active backend is now the Laravel PHP backend in `backend-laravel/`.
